Currently, there is only support for "instcal" (plus dqmask and wtmap) processing.

1. Create a data repository directory:

        $ mkdir /path/to/repo
        $ echo lsst.obs.decam.DecamMapper > /path/to/repo/_mapper

2. Get and build obs_decam:

        $ cd /path/to/work
        $ git clone git://github.com/lsst/obs_decam.git
        $ cd obs_decam
        $ setup -t <CURRENT_TAG> -r .
        $ scons install declare --tag=current

3. Import data into the data repository:

        $ cd /path/to/data
        $ setup -t <CURRENT_TAG> pipe_tasks
        $ setup -k -t <CURRENT_TAG> obs_decam
        $ ingestImagesDecam.py /path/to/repo --mode=link instcal/*.fits.fz

4. Process data

        $ setup -t <CURRENT_TAG> pipe_tasks
        $ setup -k -t <CURRENT_TAG> obs_decam
        $ processCcdDecam.py /path/to/repo --id visit=283453 ccdnum=10 --config calibrate.doPhotoCal=False calibrate.doAstrometry=False calibrate.measurePsf.starSelector.name="secondMoment" doWriteCalibrateMatches=False --clobber-config

5. Import raw data into the data repository: 

        $  ingestImagesDecam.py /path/to/repo --filetype="raw" path/to/raw/*.fits.fz

6. Import calibration data into the data repository. The calibration type can be flat/bias/fringe/defect.

        $ ingestCalibs.py /path/to/repo/  --calibType defect path/to/calib/*fits

7. Process raw data:

        $ processCcd.py /path/to/repo
